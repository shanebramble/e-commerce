# E-commerce Back End 

# Description

My challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site.I toke a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Because this application won’t be deployed, I created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. I have added a link to the video inside the README of my project.
